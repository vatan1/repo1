MCQ There are two main methods of

error detection
error correction
parity bit errors
redundancy
Answer C

The cyclic redundancy check is used in	 C	codewords	datawords	networks	transmission
To guarantee correction of up to t errors in all cases, the minimum Hamming distance in a block code must be	D	d min = 2s -1	d min = s + 1	d min= s-1	d min == 2t+ 1
The received codeword of the cyclic code is the sum of the sent 	 C	codeword and thedataword	generator	error	syndrome
In a cyclic code, the decoder is failed to detect any error, when syndrome is	 A	zero	non zero	infinity	negative value	
What is the maximum effect of a 2-ms burst of noise on data transmitted for 12 kbps	D	2 bits	4 bits1	16 bits	24 bits
the divisor line and XOR are missing if the corresponding bit in the divisor is	A	0	1	10	11
The unsigned representation of numbers by one's complement can represent	positive number	 C	negative number	Positive and negative numbers	infinite numbers
The checksum is used in the Internet by several protocols although not at the	 D	session layer	transport layer	network layer	data link layer
A simple parity-check code can detect the errors of	 A	odd numbers	even numbers	positive numbers	negative numbers
The hamming distance can easily be found if we apply the	A	XOR operation	XNOR operation	OR operation	AND operation
In subtraction of modulo-2 arithmetic, 0-1 =	C	0	-1	1	infinity
In modulo-N arithmetic, we use only the integers in the range	 B	0 to N	0 to N-1	0 to N-2	0 to N-3
To detect or correct errors, we send extra bits with data. It is called	A	redundancy		retransmission	detection	correction
A good polynomial generator of the cyclic code have at least	C	zero term	one term	two terms	three terms
A simple parity-check code can detect an	 A	odd number of errors	even number of errors	overall errors	None
A simple parity-check code is the most familia	 B	error-correcting code	error-detecting code	datawords	codewords
